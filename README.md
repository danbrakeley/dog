A logger that spins up a web browser and sends logs in real-time via websocket to one or more clients.

## How to Build

Running `build-dev.sh` will build/install the `bpak` generator, run `go generate`, run tests, then finally build the example executable. From there just run `/local/example` and connect your web browser to `127.0.0.1:8080`.
